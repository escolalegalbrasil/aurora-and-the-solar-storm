## 📖 About the Story

**Aurora** dreamed of exploring the stars and studying *space weather* — the invisible forces from the Sun that can create beautiful auroras but also interfere with satellites and power grids.

Her husband, **Peter**, is a farmer who uses technology to improve agriculture on Earth. Together, they represent the connection between **space science** and **life on our planet**.

Years later, their daughter **Stella** witnesses her mother fulfilling that dream: Aurora becomes an astronaut and travels into space to study solar storms.  
But when a massive **solar storm** damages her spacecraft, the mission becomes a global story — one filled with truth, misinformation, and the courage to fight fake news.
