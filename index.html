          My parents met when they were just kids, at a fun and exciting place called the Great World Camp for Young Scientists.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          My mother, Aurora, dreamed of becoming an astronaut, exploring the universe, uncovering its mysteries, and traveling among the stars. She loved watching the night sky and all its wonders, but her biggest passion was studying space weather.
        </p>
       
              <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
         “Space weather is like the weather on Earth,” she used to explain to my dad, “except it happens in space and is caused by the Sun. It can create amazing things like auroras, but it can also be dangerous for our satellites, power grids, and communication systems. Scientists study it to understand it better and to protect us.”
        </p>

<p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
       My father, Peter, wanted to study agronomy and become a great farmer. He often tried to teach my mother about crops and soil, but she never quite had the talent for that. Still, there was one part she absolutely loved: technology.

          “We use technology in moisture sensors and irrigation systems,” my father would say proudly. “It makes farming much more efficient.”

          Suddenly my mother called...

                <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          “Bye, Caio! I have to go now!” I said as I waved goodbye to my friend.

                <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          “See you later, Stella!” he replied.

                <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          When I got home, I found my mom bursting with excitement. She and my dad asked me to sit down. Apparently, they had some big news. I didn’t understand everything, but I caught one word: space.
                </p>
                
                <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          In that moment, my eyes filled with tears. My mother was going to space, into the vast, endless vacuum of the universe. I felt a wave of sadness, but also incredible joy. Her dream, the one she’d had since she was a little girl, was finally coming true.

          The big day had finally arrived! My mom was about to fulfill her childhood dream and finally see outer space! But not everything went as expected.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
         When everything was ready, she was already inside the solar research rocket. The launch took place with a huge crowd watching, both in person and online. She felt an overwhelming happiness as the rocket rose into the sky.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          For the first few days in space, everything went perfectly. But then the worst happened. A massive solar storm hit Aurora’s spacecraft, damaging the communication system. Without it, she couldn’t contact Earth, and that meant she couldn’t come back because there was no way to signal that it was time to begin the landing preparations.
        </p>
        
              <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
         Aurora was terrified, but deep down she knew there was still hope. If she could repair the ship, she might just find a way to make it home.

        “We are making history for the first time. We are sending a Brazilian woman to space. But what will she do up there?” you might be wondering. “She will take part in a major mission, studying space weather,” the journalist said excitedly.

        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
         When the storm hit, the lights started flickering like in a movie. The scientists panicked. The world stopped. All that echoed in the control room was the phrase, “We’ve lost communication with the spacecraft,” and worse, it was being broadcast for everyone to see.
        </p>
        
              <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
        The media exploded. The influencer then recorded a video titled, “The Worst Has Happened to Aurora.” What do you mean? My mom?
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
       In the video, he said:
“Unfortunately, we have an astronaut lost in space. Probably the worst has happened. Well, I hope everyone finds some comfort in this news.”

        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
       That had to be a lie. To make things worse, all anyone could see was a viral meme of the journalist.

          The influencer posted yet another fake news video. This time, the title was How Solar Storms affect our wellbeing. Many people watched the video, which said, “From this moment on, one in ten people will feel unwell!” How ridiculous.

        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          The worst part was that many viewers started believing they were actually feeling sick. When they went to the hospital, doctors would tell them, “Sir, you are just very nervous. There are no signs of illness.”

              <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
        A doctor named Bruna wanted to set the record straight. She treated several patients, and all of them said the same thing, “I saw it in a video on the internet that…” She took notes and asked several journalists to help her spread the word that it was fake news. But nobody wanted to help because they said the influencer would ridicule them, and they didn’t want that.

<p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
       The only one willing to help was the journalist whom the influencer had made fun of through memes. The journalist and Dr. Bruna recorded a news report designed to grab everyone’s attention.

          Meanwhile, in a place far from all of this, Helena, a driver, and Caio, Helena’s son and Stella’s friend, were struggling with the solar storm. During a trip, their GPS stopped working because of the storm, and Helena and Caio were stranded on a dirt road with forest on both sides. They didn’t know what to do.

        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          After going through so many challenges, Aurora still needed to repair the device. After a long and difficult process, she finally succeeded and restored communication. However, the device had no battery and needed time to charge. The scientists noticed that the communicator had been fixed and just had to wait for it to recharge before they could talk to Aurora. Nobody could believe it. She had to be really skilled to repair a device in the middle of a solar storm! It could only be my mom.
        </p>
       
              <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
        When the journalist shared this news with the media, everyone felt relieved, including me. But the influencer acted again. This time, he claimed that Aurora had indeed fixed the communication device, but it was impossible for her to return to Earth because a crucial part of the spaceship had broken. What a lie! He didn’t even know the condition of her ship and made it up just to get more views. How absurd! The worst part was that many people believed him and became discouraged again, including me.

          After a few hours of the device charging, the scientists finally heard my mom’s signal. “I managed to fix the ship, but I can’t stay here for long. I need to return to Earth urgently.”

       But, of course, their happiness didn’t last long. In the blink of an eye, another video appeared. This time it was different from everything before. He didn’t just take the journalist’s news out of context. No, it was worse. This time he simply said, “Guys, look at this, see this absurdity. This is our journalist, known for hiding the truth from you. Well, now it’s no different. He says they’ve managed to communicate with the lost astronaut, but it’s a lie. He’s just trying to make you believe this nonsense.”

          After going through all that, Aurora finally managed to fix the spaceship and told the Earth’s base to get ready for the landing, so she could arrive safely.
After everything was prepared, my mom reached Earth and landed perfectly! All the scientists were super happy that Aurora was back — especially because she was going to expose that influencer! It was the end of all that chaos.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
          When she landed, she was greeted with lots of applause from the scientists, and the moment was shown all around the world (even though some people still didn’t believe it was really her — they thought she was a double or maybe an AI).
Of course, the influencer made up another lie, saying it was “fake” and blah, blah, blah.
But as soon as my mom saw that video right after leaving the ship, she said:
        </p>
       
              <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">

        </p>

<p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0; text-align:left; font-size:0.7rem; line-height:1.4">
       So, it was announced that next week the astronaut Aurora would appear in public, in the main square.
The influencer told everyone not to go, saying it would be a waste of time — but people were way too curious, and thousands showed up!
